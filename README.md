# vis4bosch
This is the visualization part of our project: Data analytics and visualization for Manufactoring system.

It is to show the manufacturing status of a Bosch production process, which consists of 4 production lines, 52 working stations, and over 1000 sensors. The data set has over one million data points, which are hybrid (numerical/catagorical) and have time stamp.

This program uses modified d3 BihiSankey diagram as primary tool.
